# rainbow

This repository contains a toy implementation of [rainbow tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table),
including a small command-line interface for generating and searching through them. Functionality is fairly limited:

- Only supports MD5, which is [cryptographically broken][cb] anyway
- Basic reduction function family: add reduction index, take bottom bits, convert to ASCII alphanumeric
- Not very optimized (although it is multi-threaded, thanks to [rayon][mt])
- Plaintext length is hard-coded to 5 or 6 bytes
- Plaintext content is hard-coded to `a-zA-Z0-9_.`

# Implementation

References I found helpful are linked below, and [src/lib.rs](./src/lib.rs) is commented in some detail.

# Example

A rainbow table for 5-byte plaintexts, composed of 50000 chains of length 50000, is included at [data/50000_50000_5.table](./data/50000_50000_5.table).

This table was generated with:

```bash
$ cargo run --release -- create --chain-count 50000 --chain-length 50000 --pass-length 5 --path data/50000_50000_5.table
```

And can be used for lookup with:

```bash
$ echo -n "F0O0O" > plaintext.txt
$ md5 -q plaintext.txt
ebae3e4596d2c78e96d91c4c57f63366
$ cargo run --release -- search --path data/50000_50000_5.table --pass-length 5 ebae3e4596d2c78e96d91c4c57f63366
F0O0O
```

Naively storing all pairs of passwords and hashes would take (5B/password + 16B/hash) * 64^5 â‰ˆ 22GB.
The rainbow table only takes ~1MB of storage (although it doesn't provide perfect coverage).
